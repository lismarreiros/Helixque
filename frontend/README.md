# Helixque Frontend

This is the frontend for Helixque, a professional real-time video chat application that connects people based on preferences, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Getting Started

Make sure the backend server is running first (see main README for backend setup).

Then, run the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the next available port) with your browser.

**Important**: You'll need to allow camera and microphone permissions for the application to work properly.

## Key Components

- `app/page.tsx` - Landing page
- `app/match/page.tsx` - Device setup and preference-based user matching
- `components/RTC/DeviceCheck.tsx` - Camera/microphone setup interface
- `components/RTC/Room.tsx` - Main professional video chat room component

This project uses WebRTC for peer-to-peer video communication and Socket.IO for real-time signaling, enabling professional networking through video conversations.
