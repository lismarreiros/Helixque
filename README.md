## 🛠️ Local Development

### Frontend

The frontend is a Next.js application (App Router) that manages device selection, user preferences, UI state, and the RTCPeerConnection lifecycle.

**Development commands:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm start            # Start production server
```

**Environment variables:**

Create `frontend/.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5001
```

> **Note:** Frontend requires HTTPS in production for getUserMedia to function correctly. Device permissions must be granted by the user.

### Backend

The backend is a Node.js + TypeScript server providing Socket.IO signaling, user presence, and preference-based matchmaking.

**Development commands:**

```bash
cd backend
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm start            # Start production server
```

**Environment variables:**

Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`:

```env
PORT=5001
NODE_ENV=production
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
# Optional: REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
# Optional: STUN/TURN server configuration
```

> **Note:** Use a TURN server in production to ensure media relay when direct P2P is not possible. For multiple backend instances, configure Socket.IO Redis adapter.
