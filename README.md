## Overview

Helixque provides preference-based pairing and a lightweight signaling server to facilitate direct WebRTC peer connections. The architecture separates responsibilities between a TypeScript backend (signaling, presence, matching) and a Next.js frontend (device setup, UI, and peer connection management).

We’re continuously enhancing Helixque, evolving it into a dynamic platform. New features and improvements are on the way, and the best way to stay updated is by joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/dQUh6SY9Uk) community, where you can engage in discussions and be part of the active development journey.

## Frontend

Purpose

The frontend is a Next.js (App Router) application that manages device selection, user preferences, UI state, and the RTCPeerConnection lifecycle.

Key commands

- Install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```
- Run development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
- Build (production):

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npm start
```

Environment

Create `/frontend/.env.local` with the following minimum entry:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5001
```

Notes

- Frontend requires HTTPS in production for getUserMedia to function correctly.
- Device permissions (camera/microphone) must be granted by the user for media flows to start.

## Backend

Purpose

The backend is a Node.js + TypeScript server that provides Socket.IO signaling, user presence, and a preference-based matchmaker. It is intentionally minimal so it can scale horizontally when paired with a Redis adapter.

Key commands

- Install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```
- Run development server:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
- Build (production):

```bash
cd backend
npm run build
npm start
```

Environment

Copy `/backend/.env.example` to `/backend/.env` and set required values, for example:

```env
PORT=5001
NODE_ENV=production
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
# Optional: REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
# Optional: STUN/TURN servers can be provided via environment variables
```

Notes

- Use a TURN server in production to ensure media relay when direct P2P is not possible.
- If deploying multiple backend instances, configure the Socket.IO Redis adapter and set `REDIS_URL`.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Omelge-exe/Helixque.git
cd Helixque
```

2. Install dependencies (both services):

```bash
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

3. Start development servers (two terminals):

Terminal 1 — backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Terminal 2 — frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open the frontend in your browser (http://localhost:3000 by default) and allow camera/microphone access.

## Configuration

Backend environment example is provided in `/backend/.env.example`. Key entries:

- `PORT` — server port (default 5001)
- `CORS_ORIGINS` — comma-separated frontend origins
- `REDIS_URL` — Redis connection string (optional)
- `STUN_URLS`, `TURN_URLS`, `TURN_USERNAME`, `TURN_CREDENTIAL` — optional ICE servers

Frontend environment key:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` — public URL for the backend (use HTTPS in production)

## Socket.IO events

Client → Server

| Event | Description | Payload |
|---|---:|---|
| `offer` | Send WebRTC offer | `{ sdp: string, roomId: string }` |
| `answer` | Send WebRTC answer | `{ sdp: string, roomId: string }` |
| `add-ice-candidate` | Send ICE candidate | `{ candidate: RTCIceCandidate, roomId: string, type: 'sender' | 'receiver' }` |
| `queue:next` | Request next match | — |
| `queue:leave` | Leave queue / room | — |

Server → Client

| Event | Description | Payload |
|---|---:|---|
| `lobby` | User joined lobby | — |
| `queue:waiting` | Waiting for a match | — |
| `send-offer` | Instruct client to create/send offer | `{ roomId: string }` |
| `offer` | Deliver remote offer | `{ sdp: string, roomId: string }` |
| `answer` | Deliver remote answer | `{ sdp: string, roomId: string }` |
| `add-ice-candidate` | Deliver remote ICE candidate | `{ candidate: RTCIceCandidate, type: 'sender' | 'receiver' }` |
| `partner:left` | Remote peer disconnected | `{ reason?: string }` |

## Core components

- UserManager (backend) — queue, matching, presence, session state
- RoomManager (backend) — room lifecycle, signaling orchestration, cleanup
- Room (frontend) — RTCPeerConnection lifecycle, media controls, UI state

## Deployment

Backend (Render / Railway / Heroku)

1. Set environment variables (PORT, NODE_ENV, NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL, optional REDIS_URL and TURN_*).
2. Build and run:

```bash
cd backend
npm run build
npm start
```

Frontend (Vercel / Netlify)

1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` to your backend's HTTPS endpoint.
2. Use the platform's Next.js build pipeline. On Vercel this is automatic; `npm start` is not required.

Docker examples are included in the project to containerize frontend and backend for advanced deployments.
